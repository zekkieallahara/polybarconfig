Polybar is the polybar config

Woodblock.png is the background cropped. I do not have the uncropped image anymore.

Woodblock-color-theme.json is a bonus VS Code theme that matches. all of the colors I used for ricing appear there.

A lot of this code is pieced together from multiple sources. If I remember the resource I used, I'll place it here.

Only thing needed to do is install necessary fonts in Polybar config and update your city and Open Weather Map API key, line 55 and 56 in the Open Weather Map script.

Clicking the clock gives you Japan time, by defualt it's in Central time. You can change that in the specified script easily.
