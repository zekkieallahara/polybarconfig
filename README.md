Polybar is the polybar config

Woodblock.png is the background cropped. I do not have the uncropped image anymore.

Woodblock-color-theme.json is a bonus VS Code theme that matches. all of the colors I used for ricing appear there.

A lot of this code is pieced together from multiple sources. If I remember the resource I used, I'll place it here.
